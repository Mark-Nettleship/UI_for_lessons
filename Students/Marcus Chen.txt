Hello Marcus.
It was great to see you today.
Here are the notes from our lesson:

I had a hangover on Saturday.
I have always been interested in (motivating people.)
I guide them towards a solution.
strict <---> lenient
I'm not sure if they'd agree.
very strongest driver ---> the best driver
Now, we can only watch it on a streaming platform.
It is not efficiency ---> It is not efficient
signal to our plant side ---> inform the plant of the order
inform (someone) of (something)

I am sending you our topic for Saturday morning.
In our next lesson, we will talk about eyes. To prepare, please think about the following questions:

To keep our eyes healthy, what should we avoid? Why?
Which would you prefer to do to improve your vision* have surgery or wear contacts/glasses? Why?
How important is eye contact when you're speaking to people in Japan? Why?
If you could change one thing about your eyes, what would it be and why? (e.g., night vision, colour, etc...)
"Where words are restrained, the eyes often talk a great deal." Do you agree or disagree with this quote? Why?

I look forward to seeing you.
Kind regards,
Mark
