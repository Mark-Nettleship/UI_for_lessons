Hello Lucas.
It was great to see you today.
Here are the notes from our lesson:

I am sending you our topic for Wednesday 6th March.
In our next lesson, we will talk about advice. To prepare, please think about the following questions:

What advice would you give to someone who has trouble getting enough sleep?
What advice would you give to someone who wants to exercise more, but has a very busy schedule?
What advice would you give to a visitor to Japan about places to go and food to try?
What advice would you give to a parent whose child refuses to eat vegetables?
Imagine your friend has a job with a very good salary, but it makes them very stressed. What advice would you give them?

I look forward to seeing you.
Kind regards,
Mark
