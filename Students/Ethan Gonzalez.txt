Nobody didn't catch my call ---> Nobody took my call
"Maybe she's caught a cold."
Very changeable ---> It has changed a lot
Suddenly, it rains heavily.
We could endure hot air = We could put up with the heat

We are feeling the impacts of (climate change).
We should keep the environment in mind.

I am sending you our topic for .
In our next lesson, we will talk about cherry blossoms. To prepare, please think about the following questions:

Where are the best places to see cherry blossoms in Japan?
What do you recommend taking when someone goes cherry blossom viewing?

Cherry blossoms can be added to various kinds of food. Which would you recommend to a visitor to Japan? Why?
