I am sending you our topic for .
In our next lesson, we will talk about business strategy. To prepare, please think about the following questions:
What sort of knowledge does a manager need when developing good strategy?
What strategic errors do new companies often make?
Should profit always be the main goal of a company?
How many years into the future should a company plan?
What are the most important factors to consider when expanding a business?
I look forward to seeing you.
Kind regards,
Mark
